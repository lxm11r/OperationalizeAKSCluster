# Challenge 2: Deploy and configure your first pod

[Previous Challenge](./01-Setup-Environment.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge](./03-Azure-Monitor.md)

## Introduction

Now it is time to deploy some pods in our newly deployed cluster. Therefor you will need to apply some yaml-templates to the AKS, after you connected to it. We will use some upstream containers for that!

## Challenges

* Connect to your AKS cluster via Azure CLI
* Deploy a BusyBox Container from upstream sources by creating your own manifest
* Access your BusyBox Container via kubectl

## Success Criteria

* Config for AKS merged in local kubeconfig
* BusyBox container running and viewable via kubectl
* Container was accessed via kubectl
